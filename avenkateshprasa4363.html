            document.write("<p>I have a Masters Degree in Computer Network Engineering from a prestigious institution in Bengaluru, R V College of Engineering. I have approximately 1.5 years of work experience as a Contract Software Engineer in Dell Technologies. </p>");
            document.write("<p>While I was doing my Masters I had an opportunity to intern in a startup company, I was working as a frontend developer there and mainly used ReactJS v13 and sometimes v15. I didn't put a lot of effort to learn JavaScript, I seriously find JavaScript a weird programing language to master. I have set a short term goal to master this language and hopefully get familiar with many useful and upcoming UI libraries/frameworks.</p>");
            document.write("<p>Given any opportunity I love to take my bike on long rides, I have travelled a lot in India and would like to explore Canada as well. I love to help my Mom when she is cooking. I love to meditate and I also like solitude (when I get to spend time with my thoughts!).</p>");
